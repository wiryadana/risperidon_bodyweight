Twenty-two (mean age of 12±3.2) antipsychotic-naive patients who started therapy with risperidone were recruited. The assessment involved anthropometric data (weight, height, BMI, BMI z-score and BMI percentile), cardiovascular parameters (blood pressure and QTc interval) and blood tests (levels of glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol, glutamic oxaloacetic and pyruvic transaminases, γ-glutamyl transferase, prolactin, free triiodothyronine, free thyroxine, thyroid-stimulating hormone, thyroglobulin, antithyroid peroxidase and antithyroglobulin). After an average follow-up of 6 months of risperidone therapy, a statistically significant increase in weight and body composition was observed. Furthermore, an increase in serum levels of prolactin was observed in 50\% of patients. No other significant changes in metabolic and cardiovascular parameters were found. Although an increase in these parameters was detected, it remained in the normal range. This study suggests the use of specific protocols for monitoring children/adolescents treated with second-generation antipsychotics to manage the metabolic long-term complications and progression to more severe disease states.},

The aim of this prospective observational study  was to verify the cardiovascular and metabolic risk in a sample of  antipsychotic-naive children/adolescent patients starting risperidone therapy.  METHODS: Twenty-two patients, younger than 18 years, were recruited. The assessment  included anthropometric data, cardiovascular parameters, blood tests, and  ultrasonographic abdominal study. RESULTS: After an average follow-up period of 7.6  months, statistically significant increases in mean values of waist circumference,  body mass index (BMI), BMI percentile, BMI z score, total cholesterol, and prolactin  were found. Other cardiometabolic parameters showed an upward trend in time.  Subjects in pubertal/postpubertal stage and female patients were more susceptible to  developing cardiometabolic changes. Moreover, significant correlations between  changes in anthropometric and several metabolic parameters were found. A tendency to  change in constitution of the liver parenchyma and distribution of the abdominal fat  mass with ultrasonographic abdominal study was also evident. CONCLUSIONS: In our  sample, several metabolic parameters showed a sensitivity to risperidone treatment.  Because most of these parameters are age dependent, metabolic syndrome criteria used  for adults were inappropriate in children and adolescents. Periodic clinical and  instrumental evaluations and guidelines for monitoring of any metabolic, laboratory,  and instrumental complications are necessary in the perspective of even long-time  second-generation antipsychotics treatment in children and adolescents.},

METHODS: Weight, alanine  aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma glutamyl transpeptidase,  alkaline phosphatase and serum bilirubin of the patients were assessed in  pre-treatment period, and at the sixth and 12th months of treatment. One hundred  children and adolescents (aged between 3 and 18 years) were enrolled to the study.  RESULTS: Liver enzyme and bilirubin levels are higher than normal in 21.0\% of the  patients without clinical symptoms. No cases of hepatic failure or jaundice were  seen. Only in an 8-year-old boy were there ALT level increases up to three-fold and  AST level increases up to two-fold. After discontinuation of the risperidone  treatment, enzyme levels were normalized in this patient. Alkaline phosphatase,  alanine and aspartate aminotransferases were the most frequently increased enzymes.  CONCLUSION: In this study, after long-term risperidone treatment of children and  adolescents there was no evidence of clinically significant increases of liver  enzymes and bilirubin levels. These results indicate that risperidone treatment may  rarely cause serious liver enzyme increases, and may commonly cause clinically  insignificant changes in liver function tests.},

METHOD: This was a  24-week, multisite, randomized trial of risperidone only versus risperidone plus  parent training in 124 children (mean age 6.9 ± 2.35 years; 105 boys and 19 girls)  with ASD and serious behavioral problems. We monitored height, weight, waist  circumference, and adverse effects during the trial. Fasting blood samples were  obtained before treatment and at week 16. RESULTS: In 97 children with a mean of  22.9 ± 2.8 weeks of risperidone exposure, there was a 5.4 ± 3.4 kg weight gain over  24 weeks (p {\textless} .0001); waist circumference increased from 60.7 ± 10.4 cm to 66.8 ±  11.3 cm (p {\textless} .0001). At baseline, 59 of 97 children (60.8\%) were classified as  having normal weight; by week 24, only 25 of 85 (29.4\%) remained in that group.  Growth curve analysis showed a significant change in body mass index (BMI) z scores  from pretreatment to week 24 (p {\textless} .0001). This effect was significantly greater for  children with reported increased appetite in the first 8 weeks. From before  treatment to week 16, there were significant increases in glucose (p = .02),  hemoglobin A1c (p = .01), insulin (p {\textless}.0001), homeostatic model assessment-insulin  resistance (HOMA-IR; p {\textless} .001), alanine aminotransferase (p = .01), and leptin (p {\textless}  .0001). Adiponectin declined (p = .003). At baseline, 7 children met conventional  criteria for metabolic syndrome; by week 16, 12 additional children were so  classified. CONCLUSION: Rapid weight gain with risperidone treatment may promote the  cascade of biochemical indices associated with insulin resistance and metabolic  syndrome. Appetite, weight, waist circumference, liver function tests, blood lipids,  and glucose warrant monitoring.

METHODS: Two hundred sixteen  patients, AP naïve or quasi-naïve ({\textless}30 days on AP), were included. Total bilirubin,  the enzymes aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT),  alkaline phosphatase (ALP), weight and other parameters of MetS were measured at  baseline, and at 3, 6 and 12 months, while patients remained on the same AP.  RESULTS: At baseline, patients (mean age: 14.1 ± 3.1 years; 60.2\% male) were on  risperidone (N = 143), olanzapine (N = 37), or quetiapine (N = 36), although the  sample decreased over time to 67 patients at 12 months (risperidone N = 46,  olanzapine N = 10, and quetiapine N = 11). Around 3\% of patients had ALT/AST levels  that were at least twice the upper limit of normal (ULN) at 3 and 6 months; whereas  roughly 19\% of patients had ALP levels that were at least twice the ULN in at least  one assessment after baseline, but had no clinical symptoms. From baseline to 6  months, significant increases were observed in ALT levels in the whole sample  (p = 0.005), whereas ALP increased only in patients on risperidone. Patients showed  significant weight gain, and more individuals met criteria for MetS and AR-MetS over  time (from baseline: 2.8\% and 8.3\%, to 1 year: 10.5\% and 23.9\%, respectively). There  was a trend-level group effect in global ALT across time (p = 0.076). Patients with  MetS showed higher ALT concentrations (28.9 [18.4-39.4] U/L) than AR-MetS (20.4  [8.5-32.2] U/L), and no-AR-MetS (19.2 [8.4-29.9] U/L). CONCLUSIONS: Less than 3\% of  children and adolescents on AP during 1-year follow-up showed an increase in ALT or  AST levels in one or more of the assessments, and none of these increases was of  clinical significance. Patients with MetS and AR-MetS increased during this period,  and the possible role of ALT levels to monitor these patients deserves further  study.},

The purpose of this prospective  study is to document changes in the liver function tests (LFTs) associated with  risperidone usage in a group of children and adolescents. METHOD: Study subjects  consist of 120 youths with ages ranging from 3-17 years. For this study, patients'  baseline and follow-up weight and hepatobiliary function tests including alanine  aminotransferases(ALT) and aspartat aminotransferases (AST), gamma gluatamyl  transerase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and serum bilirubin levels were  measured before and after the treatment period of one month. RESULTS: Only one male  patient's ALT levels increased up to three-fold and AST levels increased up to  two-fold of the basal levels. First month mean levels of liver enzymes and  billuribin of the patients were significantly higher than the baseline. Sixty-three  patients (52.5\%) showed an asymptomatic increase in the liver enzymes and/or  billuribin levels of the first month of this study. Weight gain was observed in 58  patients (57.4\%). There was no significant association between changes in weight and  liver enzymes and billuribin levels. CONCLUSION: We found clinically non significant  liver function test abnormalities mostly in the form of ALP elevation in 52.5\% and  marked liver enzymes elevation in 0.8\% of risperidone-treated subjects. However use  of concomitant medications and variations in age are the limitations of this study.  These findings suggest that risperidone treatment in the short term may lead to  liver function changes in children and adolescents.},

In  addition, 37 placebo nonresponders received open-label risperidone for another 8  weeks. Of all the risperidone responders (n=65), 63 entered an open extension of  another 16 weeks (6 months total risperidone exposure), and 32 of them were  rerandomized to either continued risperidone therapy (n=16) or gradual replacement  with placebo (n=16) over 8 weeks. We collected the following measures of safety and  tolerability: (1) laboratory blood assessments (CBC with differential, electrolytes,  and liver function tests) and urinalyses, (2) vital signs, (3) Side Effects Review  of AEs thought to be associated with risperidone, (4) sleep records, (5) Simpson  Angus Neurological Rating Scale (SARS), (6) Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale  (AIMS), and (7) height and weight. No clinically significant changes were found on  the lab tests. During the 8-week acute trial, the most common AEs on the Side  Effects Review, scored as moderate or higher, were as follows (placebo and  risperidone, respectively): Somnolence (12\% and 37\%), enuresis (29\% and 33\%),  excessive appetite (10\% and 33\%), rhinitis (8\% and 16\%), difficulty waking (8\% and  12\%), and constipation (12\% and 10\%). "Difficulty falling asleep" and anxiety  actually favored the risperidone condition at statistically significant levels. The  same AEs tended to recur through 6 months of treatment, although often at reduced  levels. Using Centers for Disease Control (CDC) standardized scores, both weight and  body mass index (BMI) increased with risperidone during the acute trial (0.5 and 0.6  SDs, respectively, for risperidone; 0.0 and 0.1 SDs, respectively, for placebo) and  into open-label extension (0.19 and 0.16 SDs, respectively), although the amount of  gain decelerated with time. Extrapyramidal symptoms, as assessed by the SARS, were  no more common for drug than placebo, although drooling was reported more often in  the risperidone group. There were no differences between groups on the AIMS. Two  subjects had seizures (one taking placebo), but these were considered unrelated to  active drug. Most AEs were mild to moderate and failed to interfere with therapeutic  changes; there were no unanticipated AEs. The side effects of most concern were  somnolence and weight gain.},

However, adverse effects of risperidone may take a long time to emerge.  The objective of this study was to investigate the changes in the liver function  tests (LFTs) associated with more than 6 months of risperidone treatment in children  and adolescents. METHOD: A total of 102 youths treated with risperidone for more  than 6 months were eligible for the study. For this study, patients' baseline and  follow-up weight and hepatobiliary function tests, including alanine  aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma glutamyl  transpeptidase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and serum bilirubin levels, were  measured at baseline and at 6 months. RESULTS: Asymptomatic abnormalities of LFTs,  mostly ALP elevation, were found in 38.2\% of the cases, and marked elevation of  liver enzymes was found in 0.8\% of cases treated with risperidone. The mean levels  of liver enzymes and bilirubin of the patients were significantly higher than the  baseline after first and sixth months of treatment. However, there was no  statistically significant change in the liver enzymes and bilirubin levels between  the first and sixth months. There was no significant relationship between changes in  weight and liver enzymes and bilirubin levels after 6 months of risperidone  treatment. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that risperidone treatment in the long  term commonly leads to liver function changes, although at therapeutic doses in  children and adolescents it may rarely induce a serious hepatic toxicity.  Concomitant use of antidepressants and methylphenidate and variations in age and  pubertal status are limitations of present study. Further studies are needed to  assess the importance and role of other variables over LFT abnormalities in youth  population.},

	abstract = {Risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic drug that has been used in the treatment of numerous psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents. The question of whether  risperidone-induced weight gain is associated with steatohepatitis has recently been  raised. The purpose of this chart review was to ascertain: (1) the rate of liver  dysfunction observed during risperidone treatment in children and adolescents; and  (2) the clinical factors associated with liver dysfunction. For purposes of this  chart review study, abnormal liver function was defined by serum transaminase or  bilirubin values falling outside the normal laboratory ranges. Chart reviews were  completed on 38 youths with ages ranging from 5-17 years with a variety of  psychiatric diagnoses. The mean length of risperidone treatment was 15.2 months at a  mean dose of 2.5 mg/day. It was found that 37 of the 38 youths treated with  risperidone had no liver enzyme abnormalities at the end of study. One subject had  an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 46 U/L which was 7 U/L above the upper  limit of normal for this laboratory test. This isolated value was not considered  clinically significant. These data were noted in spite of weight gain and the use of  numerous concomitant psychotropic medications. These findings suggest that  risperidone in short term treatment does not commonly lead to evidence of abnormal  liver function at therapeutic doses in children and adolescents. Larger-scale,  prospective studies are needed in order to confirm these findings.},

	abstract = {Antipsychotics are frequently used in the treatment of a variety of neuropsychiatric conditions in children and adolescents. Atypical antipsychotics have come to the  forefront in child psychiatry due largely to their tolerability profiles as well as  their efficacy. Potential treatment options include clozapine, risperidone,  olanzapine, quetiapine and ziprasidone. A number of studies investigating the use of  clozapine have been published in children; however, owing to the frequent monitoring  required for agranulocytosis, the use of clozapine may be restricted to patients  with treatment-refractory disease. With accumulating data on the development of  glucose intolerance in adults receiving clozapine, closer monitoring of bodyweight  and fasting blood glucose is imperative. Clozapine also has an increased seizure  risk, therefore a baseline electroencephalogram should be performed, as well as  continued vigilance for this adverse effect. Risperidone is an atypical  antipsychotic that is generally well tolerated and numerous studies have been  published investigating this drug in children. Unlike clozapine, its receptor  interaction profile lends itself toward increased risk of extrapyramidal symptoms  (EPS) and hyperprolactinaemia. Bodyweight gain is a common adverse effect, although  somewhat less than that reported with olanzapine. Baseline liver function studies  prior to initiation of this medication are recommended. Risperidone-induced mania  has been reported in adults and, therefore, increased caution should be used when  deciding to treat children and adolescents with risperidone, particularly in those  with a predisposition toward mania. Olanzapine, like risperidone, has also been  associated with onset of mania in adults. Olanzapine has a receptor profile that  results in significant risk for bodyweight gain and sedation. Furthermore, this drug  has been linked to the development of glucose intolerance; thus, it is important to  monitor bodyweight and fasting blood glucose on a frequent basis. Less information  is known about quetiapine in children and adolescents. Reports about its efficacy  and tolerability vary. Quetiapine appears to have increased risk for sedation and  bodyweight gain, albeit less than that of olanzapine. The compound appears to be  less likely to induce EPS. Finally, ziprasidone has recently been approved for use  in the adult population. This compound, in terms of its receptor profile, has more  in common with risperidone. This suggests a potential for increased risk of EPS and  hyperprolactinaemia. It also has an increased risk of QTc prolongation; thus, a  baseline electrocardiogram is suggested, particularly in those patients with a  history of cardiovascular illness. Lack of evidence for bodyweight gain with  ziprasidone is a considerable advantage.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of valproic acid versus risperidone in children, 3-7 years of age, with bipolar I  disorder (BPD), during a mixed or manic episode. METHODS: Forty-six children with  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. 4th ed., Text Revision  (DSM-IV-TR) diagnosis of bipolar disorder, manic, hypomanic, or mixed episode, were  recruited over a 6 year period from two academic outpatient programs for a  double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial in which subjects were randomized in a  2:2:1 ratio to risperidone solution, valproic acid, or placebo. RESULTS: After 6  weeks of treatment, the least-mean Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) total scores  change, adjusted for baseline YMRS scores, from baseline by treatment group was:  Valproic acid 10.0±2.46 (p=0.50); risperidone 18.82±1.55 (p=0.008); and placebo  4.29±3.56 (F=3.93, p=0.02). The mixed models for repeated measure (MMRM) analysis  found a significant difference for risperidone-treated subjects versus placebo  treated subjects (p=0.008) but not for valproic acid-treated subjects versus  placebo-treated subjects (p=0.50). Treatment with risperidone over 6 weeks led to  increased prolactin levels, liver functions, metabolic measures, and weight/body  mass index (BMI). Treatment with valproic acid led to increases in weight/BMI and  decreases in total red blood cells (RBC), hemoglobin, and hematocrit. CONCLUSIONS:  In this small sample of preschool children with BPD, risperidone demonstrated clear  efficacy versus placebo, whereas valproic acid did not. The laboratory and weight  findings suggest that younger children with BPD are more sensitive to the effects of  both of these psychotropics, and that, therefore, frequent laboratory and weight  monitoring are warranted.},

Biperiden is an anticholinergic agent to treat the adverse effects of  antipsychotic drugs. The drug has the potential to induce delirium at toxic doses.  However, data are scarce about delirium associated with biperiden in children. Thus  far, a case of delirium has been associated with biperiden in an adolescent patient.  We report the first case of delirium associated with the use of biperiden in a  preadolescent patient. CASE REPORT: A boy aged five years and weighing 20 kilograms  had been diagnosed as having oppositional defiant disorder and separation anxiety  disorder in the previous treatment center. Ten milligrams fluoxetine and 0.25  milligrams risperidone had been initiated. On the third day of treatment, dystonia  developed and he was administered with biperiden. An hour later, he was brought to  our emergency clinic due to disorganized speech and behavior. His vital signs were  stable. There were no findings in blood and urine tests. No electrolyte imbalance,  liver, kidney, and thyroid dysfunction have been observed. His neurologic  examination was unremarkable and no abnormal findings were shown on cranial magnetic  resonance imaging. No other system findings or findings pointing out to infectious  diseases have been observed. One milligram physostigmine was administered with  intravenous infusion. However, symptoms did not resolve and he was diagnosed with  delirium. Naranjo Adverse Drug Reaction Probability Scale score was seven,  indicating a "Probable" Adverse Drug Reaction. Half milligram haloperidol was  administered bid for three days and he was discharged with complete recovery.  CONCLUSION: Clinicians must be aware of the risk of delirium when using non-toxic  doses of biperiden in young children.},

The aim of this pilot study was to determine the extent to  which monitoring for adverse effects was documented in health records of a cohort of  children with ID who had been prescribed antipsychotic medication. METHODS: Data  were available on all children referred to a mental health clinic at a children's  hospital in Canada who had ID and behavioral difficulties with intake appointments  between September 1, 2016 and November 30, 2017. Charts of all those on  antipsychotic medications were reviewed for a 12-week period to determine the extent  to which adverse effect monitoring was documented using the parameters stipulated by  the Canadian Alliance for Monitoring Effectiveness and Safety of Antipsychotics in  Children (CAMESA), including laboratory, anthropometric, and neurological measures.  RESULTS: The database was composed of 47 patients of whom 25 were on antipsychotics  (56\% boys; mean age 13 [SD 3] years). The most commonly used antipsychotic was  risperidone (48\%). The extent of adherence to the guidelines was (1) 96\% for weight,  height, and body mass index; (2) 84\% for extrapyramidal symptom screening; (3) 80\%  for blood pressure; (4) 64\% for abdominal girth and liver enzymes; (5) 60\% for  fasting plasma glucose; and (6) 56\% for fasting lipids. Only 20\% had all core  recommended parameters documented. CONCLUSIONS: There were significant gaps in  adverse effect monitoring in this cohort. Examination of variation in larger samples  from multiple clinical services are required to determine the extent of this quality  care gap. Several barriers to adherence are proposed with suggested solutions.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: A review of the literature from 1996-2004 on the indications and adverse reactions concerning the use of olanzapine, a second generation  antipsychotic agent, in children and adolescents with psychiatric illness is made in  this article. Studies lasted for 2 to 3 months and a few had a follow up period up  to a year. Olanzapine, dosed from 2.5 to 20 mg/day, is shown to be a useful drug in  the treatment of child and adolescent onset schizophrenia, bipolar disorder,  anorexia nervosa with delusions, pervasive developmental disorder, tic disorders,  and aggression. OPEN AND DOUBLE-BLIND STUDIES: In 4 open labeled studies (26, 34,  39, 43) and 2 case reports (25), 53 patients, aged from 6-18 years old, afflicted by  child onset schizophrenia, were treated with olanzapine for 1 1/2 weeks to one year;  19 had treatment resistant childhood schizophrenia and 34 a first episode. In the  first group 13/19 showed improvement whereas, in the second group 27/34 were  considered responders. Four patients in the first group who had responded to  clozapine (stopped because of adverse events) did less well on olanzapine. In 5  studies, 4 open labeled (15, 20, 44) and 1 double blind (27), 59 adolescent onset  schizophrenic patients were treated by olanzapine from 8 to 26 weeks; 50/59 patients  were considered responders. In the open label study (20) comparing 43 adolescents  treated by olanzapine (19 patients), risperidone (17 patients), or haloperidol (7  patients), improvement was significant in the three groups after 4 weeks of  treatment and continued after 8 weeks. It is most interesting to mention that 2  months after the end of the study 71\% (12/17) of the olanzapine group that had  completed the study, 10/15 (67\%) of the risperidone group, and 43\% (3/7) of the  haloperidol group had continued their treatment. Dropouts were for inefficacy and  non-compliance in the olanzapine and risperidone groups whereas they were also for  adverse events in the haloperidol group (2/4). A final double blind study of 263  adult and adolescent schizophrenic patients (latter are not separated from the  former) confirmed the superiority of olanzapine compared to haloperidol and its use  for a long period: 67\% of the olanzapine and 54\% of the haloperidol patients  completed the 12-week study. CASE-REPORTS: 12 case reports of children and  adolescents diagnosed with acute mania (8, 25, 46, 47) and 23 in an open labeled  study (16) were treated by olanzapine; 26/35 were considered to respond well. Some  of the patients were on mood stabilizers before adjunction of olanzapine, others on  olanzapine monotherapy; 10 case reports of patients with anorexia nervosa associated  with psychotic symptomatology, aged from 10-17 years old, relate the use of  olanzapine as adjuvant treatment. Improvement was spectacular in these patients who  not only gained considerable weight, but were also more compliant to the therapeutic  program and their obsessions, delusions, agitation and anxiety became less intense.  In this form of anorexia nervosa, olanzapine appears to have an interesting  therapeutic role and, in particular, its most important adverse effect, weight gain,  became a therapeutic goal. In 2 preliminary studies (24, 30) 31 children and  adolescents diagnosed with pervasive developmental disorder were treated by  olanzapine from 6 to 13 weeks; 18/25 had good or moderate symptomatic improvement:  they were less irritable and hyperactive, and their speech less excessive. In 17  case reports of children and adolescents with aggression (42, 45), associated with  tics in 10 patients (49), treatment with olanzapine from 2 weeks to 10 months  lowered the presenting symptoms, enhanced the cooperation, and improved the mood of  the patients. Only one patient's treatment was changed for inefficacy. DISCUSSION:  No matter what the disorder treated, when olanzapine was compared to haloperidol and  risperidone, it proved to be as effective as risperidone, and as or more effective  than haloperidol; but when compared to clozapine, it was less effective. The most  prominent adverse reaction was excessive weight gain, even more so than in adult  patients treated with olanzapine. Also weight gain was greater in children and  adolescents treated by olanzapine than those treated by risperidone or haloperidol.  Though few treatments had to be interrupted because of this side effect, child and  adolescent psychiatrists are wary of the long-term disease related to obesity and  glucose dysregulation. All should be done to under-stand the process of weight gain  better and to prevent or stall excessive caloric intake, encourage activity, and  eventually treat by corrector drugs. Secondly, sedation may bother up to 50\% of  patients even at the end of the study periods, as many as those treated by  haloperidol and more than those treated by risperidone. Extrapyramidal symptoms were  mild or moderate compared to those that appear with haloperidol, but may be more  frequent than in adult patients. Liver enzymes and blood sugar may be slightly  elevated. Prolactemia may be elevated but less so with risperidone and haloperidol.  CONCLUSION: All the authors emphasized the unfortunate lack of randomized double  blind studies for the use of olanzapine in this age group.},

	abstract = {Second generation antipsychotics (SGAs) have been linked to metabolic and bone disorders in clinical studies, but the mechanisms of these side effects remain  unclear. Additionally, no studies have examined whether SGAs cause bone loss in  mice. Using in vivo and in vitro modeling we examined the effects of risperidone,  the most commonly prescribed SGA, on bone in C57BL6/J (B6) mice. Mice were treated  with risperidone orally by food supplementation at a dose of 1.25 mg/kg daily for 5  and 8 weeks, starting at 3.5 weeks of age. Risperidone reduced trabecular BV/TV,  trabecular number and percent cortical area. Trabecular histomorphometry  demonstrated increased resorption parameters, with no change in osteoblast number or  function. Risperidone also altered adipose tissue distribution such that white  adipose tissue mass was reduced and liver had significantly higher lipid  infiltration. Next, in order to tightly control risperidone exposure, we  administered risperidone by chronic subcutaneous infusion with osmotic minipumps  (0.5 mg/kg daily for 4 weeks) in 7 week old female B6 mice. Similar trabecular and  cortical bone differences were observed compared to the orally treated groups  (reduced trabecular BV/TV, and connectivity density, and reduced percent cortical  area) with no change in body mass, percent body fat, glucose tolerance or insulin  sensitivity. Unlike in orally treated mice, risperidone infusion reduced bone  formation parameters (serum P1NP, MAR and BFR/BV). Resorption parameters were  elevated, but this increase did not reach statistical significance. To determine if  risperidone could directly affect bone cells, primary bone marrow cells were  cultured with osteoclast or osteoblast differentiation media. Risperidone was added  to culture medium in clinically relevant doses of 0, 2.5 or 25 ng/ml. The number of  osteoclasts was significantly increased by addition in vitro of risperidone while  osteoblast differentiation was not altered. These studies indicate that risperidone  treatment can have negative skeletal consequences by direct activation of osteoclast  activity and by indirect non-cell autonomous mechanisms. Our findings further  support the tenet that the negative side effects of SGAs on bone mass should be  considered when weighing potential risks and benefits, especially in children and  adolescents who have not yet reached peak bone mass.},

Behavioral rating included Childhood Autism  Rating Scale (CARS), Child Psychiatric Rating Scale (CPRS), Clinical Global  Impression (CGI), and Child-Global Assessment Scale (C-GAS). Risperidone  significantly ameliorated behavioral symptoms of PDD in 10 out of 11 subjects, with  the effects on core symptoms being of smaller amplitude and of slower onset. No loss  of effectiveness was observed in patients who continued risperidone for 12 months,  while a relapse of associated behavioral symptoms occurred in the others. Weight  gain was common, although the rate of increase lessened over a period of time; after  drug withdrawal, considerable weight loss was observed in the patient who had  previously shown the most significant increase. After 6 months of therapy, two  patients developed facial dystonia: this disappeared after reducing dosage in one  case, after drug discontinuation in the other. Amenorrhea was also observed, but no  changes in liver function, blood tests or EEG were reported. The data indicate that  risperidone is an effective and relatively safe drug for long term treatment of  behavioral disruption in autistic children and adolescents.},

This  study compared the efficacy and safety of two second-generation antipsychotics  (olanzapine and risperidone) with a first-generation antipsychotic (molindone) in  the treatment of early-onset schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. METHOD:  This double-blind multisite trial randomly assigned pediatric patients with  early-onset schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder to treatment with either  olanzapine (2.5-20 mg/day), risperidone (0.5-6 mg/day), or molindone (10-140 mg/day,  plus 1 mg/day of benztropine) for 8 weeks. The primary outcome was response to  treatment, defined as a Clinical Global Impression (CGI) improvement score of 1 or 2  and {\textgreater}or=20\% reduction in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score  after 8 weeks of treatment. RESULTS: In total, 119 youth were randomly assigned to  treatment. Of these subjects, 116 received at least one dose of treatment and thus  were available for analysis. No significant differences were found among treatment  groups in response rates (molindone: 50\%; olanzapine: 34\%; risperidone: 46\%) or  magnitude of symptom reduction. Olanzapine and risperidone were associated with  significantly greater weight gain. Olanzapine showed the greatest risk of weight  gain and significant increases in fasting cholesterol, low density lipoprotein,  insulin, and liver transaminase levels. Molindone led to more self-reports of  akathisia. CONCLUSIONS: Risperidone and olanzapine did not demonstrate superior  efficacy over molindone for treating early-onset schizophrenia and schizoaffective  disorder. Adverse effects were frequent but differed among medications. The results  question the nearly exclusive use of second-generation antipsychotics to treat  early-onset schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. The safety findings related  to weight gain and metabolic problems raise important public health concerns, given  the widespread use of second-generation antipsychotics in youth for nonpsychotic  disorders.},

	abstract = {Risperidone have been reported to commonly lead to asymptomatic elevation of liver enzymes in adult population, and recently in children and adolescents. Results from  controlled clinical trials, reports of spontaneous adverse events, and published  studies/ case reports suggest that severe hepatotoxicity may be rare but can occur  in the pediatric population. In the following case report, we describe a 5-year-old  male patient diagnosed as autism with severe distruptive behavior. Substantial  improvement was achieved with risperidone therapy. Increase in liver enzymes at the  beginning of the risperidone treatment was successfully managed with  multidisciplinary approach as the treatment was initially withdrawn, afterwards  restarted and carefully continued. We demonstrated that risperidone may be  cautiously rechallenged in selected pediatric patients who showed marked psychiatric  improvement with risperidone on the face of liver enzymes elevation. Some important  patents on risperidone delivery and their use for the treatment of autism are also  outlined.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this case study is to document hepatic adverse effects associated with long-term risperidone use in pediatric populations. Charts of all patients  admitted to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) from December 1993 to  April 1996 who had been treated with risperidone were screened for hepatotoxicity  and weight gain. From the medical records of 13 psychotic children admitted to the  NIMH and treated with risperidone, 2 children (both male) who presented with  obesity, liver enzyme abnormalities, and confirmatory evidence of fatty liver were  identified. In each case liver damage was reversed after discontinuation of  risperidone and/or associated weight loss. The observations suggest that long-term  risperidone therapy is possibly associated with hepatotoxicity in male pediatric  patients. It is recommended that pediatric patients treated with risperidone have  baseline liver function tests, careful monitoring of weight, and periodic monitoring  of liver function tests during the maintenance phase of therapy.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a progressive chronic hepatitis of unknown cause that occurs in children and adults, with a paucity of informa- tion of this  disorder existing -\_\_ in pregnancy. CASE: A primigravid pa- tient presented at 30  weeks with altered mental status, abdominal pain, vomiting, and epistaxis. Her  history was significant for por- tal hypertension, encepha- lopathy, ascites,  coagulopathy, hyperammonemia, and end-stage liver disease secondary to AIH.  Ultrasound revealed cirrhosis, ascites, splenomegaly, and an appro- priately grown  singleton gestation. She received 2 intra- muscular doses of betamethasone over 24  hours, subcuta- neous vitamin K, and oral prednisone. A lower extremity venous  Doppler study was negative for thrombosis. She received ceftriaxone 1 g daily x 5  days to treat sponta- neous bacterial peritonitis. A unit of packed red blood cells  and 1 unit of platelets were transfused prior to a primary cesarean 2 weeks after  the initial presentation. Postoperative agitation was managed with risperidone, and  wound infection was treated with vancomycinl metronidazole. She discharged herself  against medical advice on postoperative day 15, and the infant was dis- charged to  foster care on day 15 of life. CONCLUSION: Multiple management challenges usu- ally  arise in pregnancies com- plicated by end-stage - liver disease. However, with com-  prehensive multidisciplin- ary care a successful perina- tal outcome can be accom- -  plished.},
